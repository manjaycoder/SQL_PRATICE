## 🛠 Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. This repository is my journey to:

- Master SQL fundamentals.
- Work with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
- Learn query optimization and advanced SQL techniques.
- Build real-world SQL projects.

## 🗓️ 15-Day Learning Plan

### Day 1-5: Basics of SQL
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to Databases and SQL
  - Writing basic queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`
  - Filtering Data: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`
  - Sorting Results: `ORDER BY`

### Day 6-10: Intermediate SQL
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Aggregation: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
  - Grouping Data: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
  - Table Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`
  - Subqueries and Nested Queries

### Day 11-15: Practical Applications
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Writing complex queries
  - Debugging and testing SQL scripts
  - Hands-on projects with real datasets

---

## 💻 Code Examples

### Example 1: Selecting Data
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
### Example 2: Aggregating Data
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```
### Example 3: Joining Tables
``` sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.total_amount
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

Here’s an example of a README formatted for code-based GitHub repositories. I’ve fixed your example and added additional refinements to make it cohesive:
